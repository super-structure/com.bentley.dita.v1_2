# Bentley DITA V1.2 DocTypes

2019-09-17

This plug-in contains DTDs for backwards comparability for any DITA v1.2 topics or maps using Benltey's specializations. These are only shells and custom domains.

## To do

* Probably need to create a separate catalog / folder set that allows for switching the system DTD names between the two.
     * %ishlabelxpath-general-default;
    * %ishlinkxpath-general-default;
    * %ishhyperlinkxpath-general-default;
* Processing for elements which have changed their domain (i.e., class) need to have processing added back for HTML and PDF
